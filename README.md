# For Developers

If you wish to contribute to any modules, please perform the following to build any module in the project. The build system requires a unix system (WSL, Mac, or any Linux).

## Install DOIT

I have converted over to using DOIT scripts for my build environment. It works way better than a bunch of NPM scripts or regular bash shell scripts.

You can find the DOIT script project here: [DOIT](https://github.com/flamewave000/doit)
The Latest Release that can be downloaded: [Latest Release](https://github.com/flamewave000/doit/releases/latest)

## Initialize Environment

First execute the following command inside the project's root directory:

```bash
doit init
```

### Setup Foundry Environment

If you wish to use all of the commands `launch`, `devbuild` and `devwatch`, you will need to initialize the full Foundry Environment. This also requires you to have the Node version of Foundry installed. This only needs to be done once, or after you move the Server or Data directories.

```bash
doit env /path/to/foundryvtt /path/to/foundrydata
```

 - `/path/to/foundryvtt`: This is the absolute path to your FoundryVTT installation directory
 - `/path/to/foundrydata`: This is the absolute path to your FoundryVTT Data directory

### Set Target Module

To perform builds, you must set the current module target. This is done by running the following command with the desired target module's name.

```bash
doit tgt df-curvy-walls
```

## Commands

Once you have your environment and target module set up, you can simply type `doit` into the console while in the root directory and it will display all of the available commands and help docs for them.

```
localhost:~/dragonflagon-fvtt $ doit
Usage: doit <target> [args...]

TARGETS
   clean [-g]
